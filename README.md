**Pulse Pro** is now officially deprecated, and it is being replaced by the new **Pulse for Mac** app currently available in TestFlight for testing: https://testflight.apple.com/join/1jcanE3q. It was completely redesigned and has a ton of new features, including response mocking and many more.

> Pulse for Mac supports earlier Pulse versions, but version 4.x is required to use the new features
